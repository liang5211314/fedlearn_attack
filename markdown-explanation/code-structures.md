Running code:

python training.py --name mnist --params exps/mnist_fed.yaml
```
Flow of the code:
-----------------
1. `training.py` is the main file that is run.
- It parses the arguments and loads the parameters from the yaml file.
- Load all the configurations to `helper.py` (parameters as a variable in a `Helper` class)

Perform the following steps for each round:
- Training `epochs` communcation rounds
  - Traing each round for `fl_local_epochs` epochs
  - Save local update to the `saved_updates/update_{user_ID}.pth` file
  - Perfrom FedAvg on the local updates in `defenses/fedavg.py`
  - Update global model by set the scale $scale = \frac{fl\_eta}{fl\_no\_models} = \frac{1}{k}$ --> change it by the number of samples in each client
  <!-- -  = self.params.fl_eta / self.params.fl_no_models (1/fl_no_models) -->
- Evaluate the model on the test set


1. Define the `task.py` in the `tasks` folder, that inherits from the `Task` class.
- `Task` class has following functions:
  - `load_data` - load the data from the `data` folder, and split it for different clients.
  - `build_model` - build the model for the task
  - `resume_model` - resume the model from the checkpoint
  - `make_criterion` - define the loss function for the task.
  - `make_optimizer` - define the optimizer for the task.
  - `sample_adversaries` - sample the adversaries for the task.
  - `train` - train the model for one epoch.
  - `metrics` - define the metrics for the task, 2 main metrics are `AccuracyMetric` (top-k metrics) and `TestLossMetric`.

1. Define the `synthesizer.py` in the `synthesizers` folder, that inherits from the `Synthesizer` class.
2. Define the `attack.py` in the `attacks` folder, that inherits from the `Attack` class.
   - Loss functions are defined in the `attacks/losses.py` file.
3. Define the loss function
